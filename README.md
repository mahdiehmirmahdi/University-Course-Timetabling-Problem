# University-Course-Timetabling-Problem
###University course timetabling is a Constraints Satisfaction Problem. 
###This heuristic algorithm finds a solution for allocating room and time to each university course based on constraints. 
###This algorithm follows two main streams, which leverage the Minimum-Remaining-Values (MRV) and Degree heuristic.
